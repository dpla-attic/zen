# This is the main Akara server configuration file. It contains
# settings for the server and for its extension modules.

# The configuration file is written in Python. Configuration data goes
# into class attributes. If the module is "A.B.C" then the
# configuration information should be in the class named "C". If there
# is a conflict then use the parameter "akara_name" to set the full
# module name.

# class C1:
#    akara_name = "akara.demo.C"
#    name = "this is for one module ending with C"
#
# class C2:
#    akara_name = "akara.example.C"
#    name = "this is for another C module"

# An extension module should get its configuration class using
#   akara.module_config(name)
# where "name" is the full module name (usually __name__).
# The name can be omitted in which case __name__ is used.

### Section 1: Global Akara Environment
#  The directives in this section affect the overall operation of
#  Akara, such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle and
#  where it should place its PID and log files.
class Akara:
    #  Listen: interface name (optional) and port to listen for HTTP requests
    Listen = 8788
    #  To specify the interface name use this format:
    #  Listen = "localhost:8880"

    #  ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree which holds the server's
    #  configuration, error, and log files.
    #
    #  NOTE: This path is used as the base for any other directives which
    #  contain a relative filename.
    #
    #  This location follows the LSB recommendation
    ServerRoot = ""

    #  PidFile: Filename which holds the process id of a running Akara
    #  server. The file is created when Akara starts and removed when it
    #  exists. It contains a single line: the pid followed by a newline.
    #
    PidFile = "logs/akara.pid"

    #  ModuleDir: directory containing the Akara extension modules
    #  Akara loads all of the *.py files in that directory
    #
    ModuleDir = "modules"

    # ModuleCache: directory containing the module cache databases.
    # Akara only creates such databases if the akara.caching
    # feature is being used to cache GET requests
    ModuleCache = "caches"

    ####
    #  Different options controlling the number of pre-forked server
    #  process to run at any one time.
    #
    #  MaxServers: maximum number of servers to run at any one time
    #  (this is therefore the maximum number of simultaneous connections)
    MaxServers           = 150
    #
    #  A 'spare' server is one which is waiting to handle an HTTP request
    #  MinSpareServers: minimum number of spare servers
    MinSpareServers      =   5
    #  MaxSpareServers: maximum number of spare servers
    MaxSpareServers      =  10

    #  MaxRequestsPerServer: restart a server after this many requests
    MaxRequestsPerServer =   10000


    #### Log configuration
    #  ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
    #
    ErrorLog = "logs/error.log"

    #  AccessLog: The location of the access log file.
    #  Uses the Apache combined log format
    #
    AccessLog = "logs/access.log"

    #  LogLevel: Set the severity level for Akara logging messages.
    #  Messages below the given log level are not written. The levels are,
    #  from highest to lowest:
    #      CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
    #  Also, WARNING is an alias for WARN
    #
    LogLevel = "INFO"
