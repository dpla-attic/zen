Configures a standalone Moin instance for use by some Zen unit tests.

The Akara application_xml.py formatter is included in place under plugin/formatter
to simplify deployment of the tests, but should be updated if required.

Note that the standalone server also throws a series of "broken pipe" errors in
response to moinrest prodding via Zen's wikibootstrap.  This is harmless and will
not affect the tests. FIXME
