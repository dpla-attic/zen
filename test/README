To run these tests use "nose" from
  http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

or "pip install nose".

Zen uses the nose testconfig plugin which can be installed with
"pip install nose-testconfig".  Testconfig enables the use of
an ini file for configuring the tests; the file test/http.ini
should be used and configured to provide the Zen secret key as
well as Moin credentials for a user with write and delete
privileges (so that the test can upload an attachment).

These tests are also unfortunately not standalone at this point.
They assume a Moin wiki called "testwiki" be available at
http://localhost/testwiki, and also that Akara be running on
port 8880.

Once that's all setup, run;

  nosetests --tc-file=test/http.ini
