One of my favorite poets is Ezra Pound

= About =

He was an American expatriate poet, critic and intellectual who was a major figure of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist_poetry|Modernist]] movement in the first half of the 20th century. He is generally considered the poet most responsible for defining and promoting a modernist aesthetic in poetry. The critic Hugh Kenner said of Pound upon meeting him: "I suddenly knew that I was in the presence of the center of modernism."
