= dateparser =

This module parses dates and to some extent times into an ISO
timestamp. If the date is before 1AD then the timestamp will start
with a "-" but (in violation of the ISO spec) dates from 1AD and later
do not start with a '+'.

>>> import dateparser
>>> dateparser.to_iso8601("22 August, 1970")
'1970-08-22'
>>> 

See the 'dateparser.py' docstring for more examples of use. For a full
example of all supported formats, see the implementation and the tests.

Use 'nosetests' to run the tests.
